# ECG-Prosthetic-Hand

A bioelectronic prosthetic hand controlled by real-time ECG signals. This project combines biomedical signal processing, analog circuitry, and embedded programming to enable intuitive motor-driven actuation for hand movement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

**Duration:** Jan 2025 ‚Äì Mar 2025  
This system interprets ECG signals from muscle activity to control servo motors on a 3D-printed prosthetic hand, allowing for natural, real-time movement. The project integrates hardware design, signal conditioning, and embedded software.

## üîß Features

- 3D-printed prosthetic hand with 5 servo motor joints
- ECG signal capture and amplification using:
  - DC offset correction
  - **LM741** operational amplifiers
  - **AD622** instrumentation amplifier
- Real-time analog signal filtering and gain tuning
- Arduino-based ECG signal interpretation and motor control

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware & Tools

- **Arduino Uno**
- **ECG electrodes**
- **AD622**, **LM741** op-amps
- **Servo motors** (SG90 or MG996R)
- **3D-printed hand** (PLA material)
- Breadboard & resistors/capacitors for signal filtering

## üß† How It Works

1. ECG signals are collected using surface electrodes.
2. Signals are passed through analog processing circuits for filtering and amplification.
3. Arduino reads processed ECG waveforms, identifies muscle contractions, and maps them to motor actuation patterns.
4. Servo motors respond in real time to open or close the prosthetic hand.

## üß™ Results

- Achieved responsive, muscle-controlled hand movements with minimal delay.
- Real-time filtering significantly improved control accuracy and reduced false activations.

## üß† Code Files

- **`test_motor.ino`** ‚Äì Simple motor test script that alternates servo position every 5 seconds.
- **`Test_ECG_Signal.ino`** ‚Äì Reads analog ECG input, converts it to voltage, and outputs it via serial monitor for signal analysis.
- **`ECG_hand_control.ino`** ‚Äì Core logic: interprets ECG signals and controls servo movement based on threshold detection and signal count logic. Includes timeout handling for inactivity and resets.
